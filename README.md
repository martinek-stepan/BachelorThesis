# Bachelor thesis
My bachelor thesis was about possibilities to help improve the self-esteem of a person by gamification and utilizations of so-called “serious games”. Server in Node.js & MySQL and Android client in Kotlin were made for this prototype.

To achieve that there is the main “serious game” where a player is taking care of a plant and trying to make it grow. To achieve that, the flower needs to be watered, get minerals and fertilizer. To do so the player pays with coins, which can be obtained by fulfilling therapeutic tasks and minigames.

Implemented tasks:
*	Self-reflection
*	Self-supporting arguments
*	Achievements

All the task require user submit text responses. A special task is “Validating of others” which allows you to anonymously validate some of the answers by other players. That aim to reduce the cost of running the game.

Minigames:
*	Pexeso (match smiley faces)
*	Matrix (find all smiling faces in the matrix of faces)
